# mod2chal
## Description


Motivation behind this project was to make something from scratch utliziing everything we had learned. This project was made to show what I had learned so far in the classes, and to bring attention to any weak points in my learning so far. I learned that labeling a div with a class/id has to match the element's class/id correctly, how to resize images.
